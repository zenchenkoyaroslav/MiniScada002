# MiniScada002

It was my first android development experience. 
I was mading it in team of three second-year students. We knew little and were left to ourselves. 
So no one could help us with android programming specifics.
This app send command to microcontroller, that can control different systems in a house.
Ideally, it might become some kind of "Smart home system", but unfortunately it has never been completed because of some reasone.
